This is the folder I created for the project 4 and did not integrate with the lastest Team Commit.
What I have done in this Project 4.
1. Chessboard UI and enable users to click the square to see any valid moves 
2. Connect the frontend Chessboard UI to the backend with Socket.io
3. Enable multiple players mode so that I can have the 2 same client applications open and 1 server application open. 
4. Complete the functionality of Forfeit Button and Offer Draw Button
5. Store FEN, PGN and SAN objects in Redux.
6. Did not complete database implementations which do not meet the major requirements of Project 4
7. Can see the game outcomes.
