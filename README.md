## ✨ Above and Beyond

## 🔮 Future of Castle & Conquer
- Add a login system that allows users to save their games in our chess database. This also allows for a username-based invite system and a friend system. A barebones login system was in the works by Jason Lai, but was scrapped due to logistical reasons.
- Extend our existing Stockfish AI framework (being used for game analysis) to enable players to play against an AI-controlled bot with varying difficulties.
- Develop and deploy a persistent leaderboard or player rating system, built upon the login system.
- Other QOL changes, like allowing players to change the theme of the board.
